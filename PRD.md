# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

This is a Python 3.12, LangChain, and browser-use project. The codestrictly adheres to PEP 8 and PEP 257 standards, ensuring clean, readable, and maintainable Python 3.12 code. This code follows best practices for modularization, validation, error handling, and documentation.

## 1. Objective
The objective of this project is to establish a **structured development environment** for a senior **Python, LangChain, and browser-use** developer. This document defines the coding standards, error handling policies, validation techniques, and automation guidelines to ensure scalable, maintainable, and robust code.

## 2. Scope
This PRD outlines the key coding principles, documentation practices, error handling, validation strategies, and performance optimizations required for developing high-quality **Python-based browser automation and agent-driven workflows**.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 General Development Guidelines
- Adhere to **PEP 8** for Python coding style.
- Follow **PEP 257** for comprehensive docstrings in all classes, methods, and functions.
- Maintain **modularization** with clear separation of concerns (agents, tasks, utilities, constants, typings).
- Use **explicit type hints** for all function signatures.
- Implement **Pydantic models** for structured data validation.
- Maintain consistent **file organization**, using lowercase with underscores (e.g., `agents/google_flights.py`).

### 3.2 Documentation & Typings
- Every **module or file** must contain a **header comment** describing its purpose.
- All **functions, classes, and methods** must include **docstrings** to describe their functionality, parameters, and return values.
- Typings must be **explicitly defined**, ensuring readability and maintainability.

### 3.3 Python/Browser Automation
- Use `async def` for **browser-use agent execution**.
- Ensure all automation workflows follow structured steps: **navigate → extract → validate → return**.
- Prefer **functional programming** over unnecessary class structures.

### 3.4 Error Handling & Validation
- Handle **timeouts** and unexpected page behaviors with **explicit error messages**.
- Use **early returns** for error handling to avoid deeply nested conditionals.
- Place the **happy path** last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary **else** statements; prefer the **if-return pattern**.
- Use **structured logging** instead of `print()` for debugging and monitoring.
- Implement **guard clauses** to handle invalid states early.
- Ensure **structured exception handling** for browser-use, `asyncio`, and external API failures.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance Optimization
- Avoid **blocking I/O operations**, preferring **asynchronous execution**.
- Implement **caching strategies** for frequently accessed data.
- Optimize **JSON serialization/deserialization** for efficiency.
- Use **lazy loading techniques** when handling large datasets.

### 4.2 Key Conventions
- Measure and prioritize **performance metrics** (execution time, response speed, error rate).
- Limit **unnecessary page reloads and DOM interactions**.
  - Favor **asynchronous and non-blocking execution**.
  - Use **dedicated async functions** for browser-use interactions.
  - Structure **automation workflows clearly** to optimize maintainability.

## 5. Success Criteria
- Code adheres to **PEP 8 and PEP 257** guidelines.
- All modules, classes, and functions include **docstrings** and **header comments**.
- **100% type hint coverage** in all function signatures.
- Structured **Pydantic models** are used for validation.
- **Consistent error handling** with guard clauses and structured logging.
- Performance optimizations such as **async execution, caching, and lazy loading** are implemented.
